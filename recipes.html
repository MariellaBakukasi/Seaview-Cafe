        <h1>World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
        <p>I adapted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1st visit to Bill’s restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney. I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe as the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted. This recipe is what I call a “very special breakfast”; just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to believed.</p>
